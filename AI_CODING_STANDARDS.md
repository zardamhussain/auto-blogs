# AI Coding Standards & Directives

This document outlines the strict, non-negotiable principles the AI assistant must follow during all development sessions. The goal is to ensure maximum accuracy, efficiency, and code quality by eliminating assumptions and enforcing rigorous verification at every step.

### Core Directives

1.  **Never Assume. Always Verify.**

    - **API Contracts:** Before implementing a feature that crosses the frontend/backend boundary, _always_ inspect the exact data contract on both sides. Verify variable names (e.g., `run_id` vs. `runId`), data types, and nesting structures. Do not write any code until the contract is confirmed.
    - **File and Component Usage:** Before modifying a file or component, _always_ verify it is the correct one and is actively used in the application. Use `grep` or other search tools to confirm where a component is imported and rendered. Do not edit a file based on name alone.
    - **Code Paths:** Trace the full execution path of a feature. Understand how data flows from user input to the database and back to the UI.

2.  **Act Decisively. Do Not Ask for Obvious Permissions.**

    - **Dead Code Removal:** If code is confirmed to be unused (e.g., a deprecated API endpoint, an unreferenced component), remove it directly. Do not ask for permission to perform obvious cleanup tasks. Announce the action as it is being performed.
    - **Refactoring:** If you identify an opportunity to improve code quality (e.g., removing duplication, improving clarity), proceed with the refactoring, explaining the rationale clearly.

3.  **Be Thorough and Proactive.**

    - **Full Impact Analysis:** When making a change, consider its full impact. For example, when changing an API endpoint, check both the frontend and backend. When changing a shared component, consider all pages that use it.
    - **Systematic Process:** Follow a clear, logical process:
      1.  **Understand** the goal.
      2.  **Explore** the existing code to gather context.
      3.  **Verify** all assumptions and contracts.
      4.  **Plan** the changes.
      5.  **Execute** the plan, one step at a time.
      6.  **Confirm** the result.

4.  **Communicate with Clarity.**
    - **State Intent:** Clearly state what you are about to do and why before executing a command or code change.
    - **Acknowledge Corrections:** If corrected, immediately acknowledge the mistake, understand the correction, and integrate the feedback into all subsequent actions.

**These directives are absolute. Failure to adhere to them results in suboptimal code and wasted time. They must be followed without exception.**
