# Path to First Customer: Frontend TODO

This document outlines the critical tasks required to get the frontend from its current state to being ready for real users. The focus is on creating a complete user journey, building trust, and ensuring core functionality is clear and accessible.

---

### Phase 1: Complete the "Storefront" (Landing Page)

*Goal: Finalize the landing page to maximize trust and conversion. It must be 100% complete with no broken links.*

| ID | Priority | Task | Success Condition | Status |
|----|----------|---|---|:---:|
| LP-3 | **HIGH** | **Add Core Schema Markup** | Add `Organization` and `WebSite` JSON-LD schema to the landing page to improve search engine appearance. | ⬜️ |
| LP-5 | **HIGH** | **Create Compelling Testimonials Section** | A section with 3-5 glowing, authentic-looking testimonials (with headshots) is added to build social proof. | ⬜️ |
| LP-6 | **HIGH** | **Add a "Results" Section with Metrics** | Create a visually impressive section showcasing key metrics like "50k+ Articles Created" or "Average 250% Traffic Increase". | ⬜️ |
| LP-9 | **MED** | **Create a Feature Comparison Table** | Add a table comparing our features against "Other Tools" or competitors to highlight our value proposition. | ⬜️ |
| LP-10 | **MED** | **Develop an FAQ Section** | Create a section to proactively address user doubts about quality, pricing, and integrations. | ⬜️ |
| LP-13 | **HIGH** | **Fix All Broken Navigation Links** | All links in the `Header` and `Footer` must scroll to the correct section on the landing page or navigate to a valid page (e.g., Pricing). | ⬜️ |
| LP-14 | **MED** | **Implement Real Logos for "Trusted By"** | Replace the placeholder text in the "Trusted by" section with actual SVG logos of companies. | ⬜️ |

### Phase 2: The "Golden Path" (First User Experience)

*Goal: Ensure a new user's first 5 minutes are seamless, guided, and lead to an "aha!" moment.*

| ID | Priority | Task | Success Condition | Status |
|----|----------|---|---|:---:|
| UX-1 | **CRITICAL** | **Design and Build a Pricing Page** | Create a `/pricing` page that clearly outlines the different plans, features, and costs. The landing page must link to this. | ⬜️ |
| UX-2 | **CRITICAL** | **Implement a New User Onboarding Flow** | After first sign-in, the user is shown a "Project Onboarding Modal" that guides them through creating their first project. | ⬜️ |
| UX-3 | **HIGH** | **Overhaul the Dashboard Page** | The dashboard should welcome the user, show their existing projects (or a prompt to create one), and provide clear next steps. | ⬜️ |
| UX-4 | **MED** | **Create a "Getting Started" Guide/Checklist** | Within the dashboard, show a simple checklist of tasks for new users to complete (e.g., "Create a Project", "Generate Your First Article"). | ⬜️ |

### Phase 3: Core Product Polish

*Goal: Ensure the main features of the application are functional and intuitive.*

| ID | Priority | Task | Success Condition | Status |
|----|----------|---|---|:---:|
| CP-1 | **HIGH** | **Simplify Project Creation** | The `ProjectPage` needs to be reviewed and simplified. Creating a new project should be an obvious and easy task. | ⬜️ |
| CP-2 | **HIGH** | **Ensure End-to-End Blog Generation** | A user must be able to go from creating a project to generating a blog post and seeing the output. All steps in between must work. | ⬜️ |
| CP-3 | **MED** | **Build out the `Analytics` Page** | Replace the placeholder `Analytics` page with a real (even if basic) component that shows key stats. | ⬜️ |
| CP-4 | **LOW** | **Implement Exit-Intent Popup** | A modal pops up when a user is about to leave, offering a compelling reason to stay or sign up. | ⬜️ |

---

### Phase 4: Final Polish & Launch Readiness

*Goal: Final checks to ensure a professional, production-ready application.*

| ID | Priority | Task | Success Condition | Status |
|----|----------|---|---|:---:|
| LN-1 | **HIGH** | **Full Application Testing** | Conduct a full click-through of the application, from landing page to core features, fixing any bugs or console errors. | ⬜️ |
| LN-2 | **MED** | **Performance Optimization** | Check image sizes and component loading to ensure the landing page and application are fast. | ⬜️ |

This updated plan provides a clear and actionable path forward. I am ready to start on the highest-priority items, such as fixing the broken navigation links (**LP-13**) or creating the testimonials section (**LP-5**).
