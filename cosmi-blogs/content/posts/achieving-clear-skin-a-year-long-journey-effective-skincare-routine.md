# From Acne Struggles to Clear Skin: My Year-Long Transformation

For years, I battled relentless acne, particularly on my cheeks and chin. Countless drugstore products, topical antibiotics, oral medications, retinoids, and diet changes yielded no results. Cystic acne seemed like a never-ending ordeal.

## The Turning Point: Hormonal Birth Control & Simplified Skincare

In February 2022, my dermatologist prescribed hormonal birth control (Teva-cyproterone/ethinyl estradiol) to address my PCOS symptoms, hoping for positive results on my skin as well. After about four months, I finally started seeing improvements. I'm still on it, and my skin has never been better!

I also embraced a simplified skincare routine. By focusing on ingredients that worked for me, and slowly introducing actives, I saw significant progress. My favorites include hyaluronic acid, aloe, benzoyl peroxide, and retinol.

## My Current Skincare Routine for Combo Skin

My skin is combination, and my primary concerns are post-inflammatory erythema (PIE), texture, occasional breakouts, and overall redness. Here's what I use:

### AM Routine

*   **Garnier Cleansing Micellar Water (Hyaluronic Acid + Aloe):** Applied with a cotton pad for gentle cleansing.
*   **The Ordinary Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution:** A hydrating and redness-reducing serum.
*   **Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream (Extra-Dry, Fragrance-Free):** Lightweight moisturizer to hydrate without clogging pores.
*   **Paula's Choice CALM Redness Relief Mineral SPF 30:** Essential sun protection (although I admit, I don't always reapply).

### PM Routine

*   **Garnier Cleansing Micellar Water (Hyaluronic Acid + Aloe):** To remove makeup and impurities.
*   **Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser (Creamy, Fragrance-Free):** A gentle cleanser that doesn't strip the skin.
*   **CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum:** (Alternated with The Ordinary Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution) For texture and anti-aging.
*   **Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream (Extra-Dry, Fragrance-Free):** Hydration overnight.

### Extras

*   **Clean & Clear Persa-Gel 5 (Benzoyl Peroxide):** Spot treatment for breakouts.
*   **Paula's Choice Purifying Clay Mask:** For deep cleaning and minimizing pores.
*   **COSRX Pimple Master Patches:** To heal blemishes overnight.

## Top 3 Game-Changers

1.  **Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser (Creamy Formula):** Unlike other cleansers, this one leaves my skin feeling clean and hydrated. The foaming version irritated my skin.
2.  **The Ordinary Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution:** This serum is a game changer for redness! It's slippery, sticky, fast-absorbing, and gives a radiant glow. It has a cooling effect and helps with residual redness.
3.  **Paula's Choice CALM Redness Relief Mineral SPF 30:** An amazing mineral sunscreen. It has a whipped texture, no white cast, doesn't pill, and neutralizes redness. It pairs well with the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream and doesn't irritate my eyes.

## Helpful Habits for Clear Skin

I believe these habits also contributed to my success:

*   Frequently changing my bedding.
*   Using unscented detergent.
*   Washing my hands between each skincare step.
*   Disinfecting product containers weekly.
*   Avoiding touching my face.
*   Drinking more electrolytes.

## The Takeaway

Finding the right combination of hormonal treatment and a tailored skincare routine has transformed my skin and confidence. Don't give up â€“ with patience and research, you can find what works for you!

Experiences shared online highlight the importance of finding the right birth control for hormonal acne. A consistent and well-researched skincare routine also helps, which boosts confidence!
