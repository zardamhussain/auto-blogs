# The Unexpected Journey of Adult Acne at 28

Acne is often associated with teenage years, but for many, it can reappear or even manifest for the first time in adulthood. Experiencing sudden and severe breakouts later in life can be particularly distressing, impacting self-esteem and daily life. This is the story of someone who faced this challenge head-on when, at the age of 28, previously clear skin began to develop painful, cystic acne.

## When Breakouts Begin (Again)

Having enjoyed clear skin for years with only minor, cyclical blemishes, the sudden onset of inflamed breakouts on the face, jawline, and chin was unexpected and overwhelming. These were not just simple pimples but deep, painful cystic lesions that seemed resistant to conventional approaches. The emotional toll was significant, leading to feelings of embarrassment and a desire to avoid public situations.

Despite efforts to manage the condition with various products, nothing seemed to provide relief, leading to a period of frustration and searching for more effective solutions.

## A Shift Towards Intensive Treatment and Simplification

A turning point in this journey involved a significant change in strategy: simplifying the daily skincare routine drastically while incorporating a powerful clinical treatment. The chosen intervention was CO2 laser skin resurfacing. Known for its aggressive nature and effectiveness in treating a wide range of concerns, including scarring and texture issues, CO2 laser offered the potential for significant skin transformation.

While the recovery process was reported to be challenging and involved significant downtime, the results witnessed just three weeks post-treatment were promising, showing marked improvement in the appearance of the skin. This demonstrates that sometimes, more intensive treatments can be necessary to address severe adult acne and its aftermath.

## Supporting Skin Health: Inside and Out

Complementing the laser treatment and minimalist topical routine, an internal approach was adopted. Daily supplements including a probiotic, omega-3 fatty acids, and zinc were introduced. Zinc, in particular, is frequently discussed for its potential anti-inflammatory properties that may benefit acne-prone skin, an insight shared by others who have found it helpful for jawline and chin breakouts.

Alongside internal support, maintaining strict hygiene practices became paramount. Regularly cleaning makeup brushes and ensuring pillowcases are fresh were crucial steps taken to minimize external factors that could contribute to breakouts.

## A Complex Picture: Hormones and Habits

It's worth noting that adult acne, especially sudden onset, can sometimes be linked to hormonal changes or other internal factors, even when maintaining a relatively healthy lifestyle with good diet, infrequent alcohol consumption, and being a non-smoker. Understanding this can help manage expectations and reduce self-blame, recognizing that sometimes breakouts happen despite best efforts.

## The Path to Recovery and Acceptance

Three weeks after the intensive treatment and approximately a month and a half into the supplement regimen, the skin shows significant progress. The journey involves not only healing but also managing habits like picking, utilizing tools like pimple patches to aid in this. While the skin is not yet exactly as it was before the flare-up, the current state is viewed with acceptance and optimism for continued improvement.

This experience underscores that adult acne can be a difficult and complex condition requiring patience and a willingness to explore various treatment avenues, potentially combining clinical procedures with foundational skincare and internal support.

For those curious about intensive laser treatments, sharing the details of the CO2 laser process and recovery can offer valuable perspective on what to expect from such procedures.
