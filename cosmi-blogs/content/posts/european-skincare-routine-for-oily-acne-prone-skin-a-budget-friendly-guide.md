# A European Skincare Routine for Oily, Acne-Prone Skin

Dealing with oily, acne-prone skin can be frustrating, especially on a budget. This post outlines a simple yet effective AM/PM skincare routine, inspired by insights from skincare enthusiasts, using affordable products readily available in Europe.

## Understanding Oily, Acne-Prone Skin

Oily skin often leads to clogged pores and breakouts. A good routine focuses on gentle cleansing, effective active ingredients, and lightweight hydration, without stripping the skin of its natural moisture.

## AM Routine: Keeping it Simple

1.  **Gentle Cleanse (Optional):** Instead of harsh cleansers, just splash your face with water in the morning to avoid dehydration. Over-cleansing can worsen oil production.

2.  **Azelaic Acid (Skinoren):** A prescription-strength 20% azelaic acid (Skinoren) can be a game-changer. It helps reduce redness and inflammation without excessive drying. *Note:* Consult a dermatologist for prescription options.

3.  **Lightweight Hydration:** The Neutrogena Hydro Boost Creme Gel provides ample moisture without feeling heavy. In winter, it pairs well with hydrating sunscreens. Consider adding a few drops of The Ordinary Niacinamide for extra benefits.

4.  **Sun Protection is Key:** The Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun SPF offers great protection, especially during cooler months. Remember to reapply throughout the day! Finding the right sunscreen is crucial.

## PM Routine: Targeting Acne and Hyperpigmentation

1.  **Double Cleanse (If Necessary):** Even without makeup, an oil cleanser is recommended to remove SPF effectively. Follow with a gentle cleanser containing 2% salicylic acid, like Neutrogena Visibly Clear, to unclog pores.

2.  **Tretinoin/Clindamycin (Zalna):** A prescription topical containing tretinoin (0.025%) and clindamycin (1%) can be highly effective for acne. Use sparingly to avoid dryness. Allow it to absorb for about 15 minutes.

3.  **Gentle Exfoliation:** The Ordinary Mandelic Acid is a great starting point for AHAs. It provides gentle exfoliation without irritation, even when used alongside tretinoin. 

4.  **Azelaic Acid (Skinoren):** Apply Skinoren to further target inflammation and hyperpigmentation. Let it sink in for another 15 minutes.

5.  **Rich Moisturizer:** The La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 is a fantastic night cream, offering deep hydration without feeling too heavy. Mixing it with The Ordinary Niacinamide can create a lighter consistency while boosting its benefits.

6. **Lip Care**: Applying Vaseline before going to bed keeps your lips moisturized during sleep.

## Important Considerations

*   **Listen to Your Skin:** This routine is a starting point. Adjust product usage based on how your skin feels.
*   **Active Ingredients:** Be cautious when combining actives like tretinoin, salicylic acid, and azelaic acid. Start slowly and monitor for irritation. Overdoing it can lead to dryness and sensitivity.
*   **Product Recommendations:** While specific products are mentioned, look for similar formulations with comparable ingredients if those aren't available in your area.
*   **Consult a Dermatologist:** For prescription-strength treatments like tretinoin and azelaic acid, seek professional advice.

## Final Thoughts

Building a consistent and well-thought-out skincare routine is essential for managing oily, acne-prone skin. By focusing on effective ingredients, gentle cleansing, and adequate hydration, you can achieve a healthier, clearer complexion without breaking the bank.
