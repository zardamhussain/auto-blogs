Cloudy days might feel like a break from the sun, but is it safe to skip sunscreen? Many assume that overcast skies protect them from UV damage, yet this is far from true. Here’s why sunscreen remains essential every day, plus how [Cosmi’s AI-powered Face Scan ](https://www.cosmi.skin/)can guide you in making smarter skincare choices, rain or shine.

### **Why Sunscreen Matters – Even on Cloudy Days**

**1. UV Rays Penetrate Clouds**
Though clouds may dull the sunlight, up to 80% of harmful UV rays still reach your skin. Both UVA and UVB rays penetrate clouds, contributing to skin aging, sunburn, and even skin cancer. By skipping sunscreen, you’re still exposing your skin to these harmful effects.

**2. Cumulative Sun Damage**
Sun exposure accumulates over time, meaning each moment outside—even on cloudy days—adds up. Wearing sunscreen daily helps protect against early signs of aging, like fine lines and dark spots, and reduces the long-term risk of skin cancer.

**3. Indirect Sunlight Exposure**
UV rays can reflect off surfaces like water, sand, and even concrete, meaning you’re still exposed even without direct sunlight. While clouds might reduce heat, indirect UV exposure remains high enough to cause damage, making sunscreen a must.
