Between your growing pile of skincare products and trying out viral routines that don’t always turn out as expected, achieving clear and healthy skin can feel like an impossible task. But trust us—it’s not. The secret lies in a targeted skincare routine that addresses your specific concerns and delivers the right kind of TLC. Wondering how to get started? Keep reading for expert-backed tips on how to get clear skin.

## Tips on How to Get Clear Skin

### 1. Opt for Noncomedogenic Products
Dr. Haleh Bakshandeh emphasizes that achieving clear skin means having a complexion free of acne and blemishes, including those left behind by past breakouts. **Noncomedogenic** products won’t clog your pores, which is crucial in maintaining a blemish-free complexion.

#### Featured Product: **ESPA Balancing Treatment Oil**
- **Key Ingredients**: Lemon and Rose Geranium, Jojoba, and Avocado Oils
- **Skin Type**: Acne-Prone, Oily, Combination
- **Beauty Insider Tip**: For best results, warm a few drops between your palms before applying to your face and neck until fully absorbed.

### 2. Cleanse Morning and Night with a Gentle Face Wash
Cleansing should always be the first step in your skincare routine, whether morning or night. It helps to remove dirt, excess oil, makeup, and acne-causing bacteria.

#### Featured Product: **iS Clinical Cleansing Complex**
- **Key Ingredients**: Willow Bark, Centella Asiatica, Chamomile
- **Skin Type**: All skin types
- **Beauty Insider Tip**: This cleanser is great for both men and women of all ages and also helps in shaving.

### 3. Try Double Cleansing
Double cleansing is essential when you need to remove stubborn makeup and dirt. This routine consists of using an oil-based cleanser followed by a water-based cleanser for maximum results.

#### Featured Product: **Elemis Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm**
- **Key Ingredients**: Star Flower Oil, Elderberry Oil, Padina Pavonica
- **Skin Type**: All skin types
- **Beauty Insider Tip**: Use as a face mask for extra pampering. Leave it on for 10 minutes before removing with a warm washcloth.

### 4. Incorporate a Toner
For those with oily or acne-prone skin, toners can help hydrate, tighten pores, and rebalance oil production. Newer toner formulations with hyaluronic acid and antioxidants are gentle and effective.

#### Featured Product: **Caudalie Beauty Elixir**
- **Key Ingredients**: Grapes, Rose Oil, Rosemary
- **Skin Type**: All skin types
- **Beauty Insider Tip**: Keep it in the freezer for an instant cooling effect.

### 5. Fight Acne the Right Way
While picking at acne is tempting, it’s important to follow a proper skincare routine to fight breakouts. Look for products that contain acne-fighting ingredients while keeping your skin barrier intact to avoid irritation.

#### Featured Product: **Obagi Medical Acne Cleansing Wipes**
- **Key Ingredients**: Aloe, Salicylic Acid, Citrus Bioflavonoids
- **Skin Type**: Oily or Acne-Prone Skin
- **Beauty Insider Tip**: Start with once-a-day use to avoid over-drying, and gradually increase usage.

### 6. Use a Topical Acne Treatment
For more serious breakouts, consider topical treatments with acne-fighting ingredients like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. These treatments can also prevent future acne flare-ups.

#### Featured Product: **PCA SKIN Acne Gel**
- **Key Ingredients**: Salicylic Acid, Hexylresorcinol, Ethyl Linoleate
- **Skin Type**: Oily, Acne-Prone, Combination, Normal
- **Beauty Insider Tip**: Use as a spot treatment or full-face treatment if your skin is particularly oily.

### 7. Apply a Niacinamide Moisturizer
Dr. Bakshandeh recommends using a good moisturizer to help preserve the skin’s natural barrier. **Niacinamide** (vitamin B3) helps reduce acne-related concerns, like discoloration and dryness.

#### Featured Product: **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer**
- **Key Ingredients**: Ceramide-3, Niacinamide, Prebiotic Thermal Water
- **Skin Type**: All skin types
- **Beauty Insider Tip**: Apply both day and night for ultra-hydrated skin.

### 8. Exfoliate Regularly
Exfoliating 1-2 times a week with AHAs and BHAs can help clear away dead skin cells, unclog pores, and improve skin texture. This also helps prevent blackheads and other complexion issues.

#### Featured Product: **Paula’s Choice SKIN PERFECTING 2 BHA Liquid Exfoliant**
- **Key Ingredients**: Salicylic Acid
- **Skin Type**: All skin types
- **Beauty Insider Tip**: Use a dime-sized amount and avoid the eyelids. Always wear SPF after exfoliating.

### 9. Add a Retinol Serum
**Retinol** is known for enhancing collagen production, speeding up cell turnover, and improving skin texture. It can help clear breakouts and fade acne scars over time.

#### Featured Product: **iS Clinical Pro-Heal Serum Advance Plus**
- **Key Ingredients**: Retinol, Vitamin C, Zinc Sulfate
- **Skin Type**: All skin types
- **Beauty Insider Tip**: Ideal for sensitive skin, despite its potent formula.

### 10. Brighten Skin with Vitamin C
Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that can help brighten skin, fade discoloration, and reduce the appearance of acne scars. It also has anti-aging benefits.

#### Featured Product: **Allies of Skin 35% Vitamin C Perfecting Serum**
- **Key Ingredients**: Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate
- **Skin Type**: All skin types
- **Beauty Insider Tip**: This serum boosts the effects of SPF, and can be used around the eye contour to brighten tired eyes.

### 11. Wear SPF
The importance of sunscreen cannot be overstated. Sun damage is a major cause of premature aging, hyperpigmentation, and uneven skin tone. Always apply sunscreen, even on cloudy days.

#### Featured Product: **EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46**
- **Key Ingredients**: Niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, Zinc Oxide
- **Skin Type**: All skin types
- **Beauty Insider Tip**: Ideal for rosacea and acne-prone skin, as it calms inflammation.

### 12. Keep Your Skin Hydrated
Dehydrated skin leads to itchiness, dryness, and a dull complexion. Dr. Connie Yang recommends staying hydrated inside and out to ensure your skin gets the moisture it needs to remain healthy.

### 13. Catch Enough Sleep
A good night's sleep is essential for skin repair. When your body rests, it also heals the damage done to your skin. Lack of sleep can lead to dull skin and even trigger breakouts.
