# 2. Understanding Freckles: Their Causes and Types

Now that we're all set to become freckle-spotting pros, let's dig deeper into understanding what causes freckles and the different types you may come across. Freckles are small, flat spots that appear on the skin, usually lighter in color than the surrounding area.

The main cause of freckles is an increase in the production of a pigment called **melanin**, which gives color to our skin, hair, and eyes. When the skin is exposed to the sun, it triggers the production of melanin, leading to freckles.

There are two main types of freckles:  

- **Ephelides** – These are the common freckles that typically appear on the face, arms, and shoulders, mostly in fair-skinned individuals.  
- **Solar lentigines** – These are larger and darker freckles that primarily result from prolonged sun exposure.

Knowing the causes and types of freckles will help you identify and appreciate the uniqueness of your skin. So, let's move on to the next section where we'll discuss some interesting facts about freckles. Stay tuned!

Now that you've mastered the art of freckle-spotting, it's important to understand how freckles differ from other common skin spots. While freckles are harmless and usually fade in the winter, other types of spots may require closer attention.
