## **Why a Daily Routine Matters**

Glowing skin is the result of consistency and the right products. A daily skincare routine protects your skin from environmental damage and nourishes it to stay healthy.

With hectic schedules, it’s easy to skip steps, but neglecting skincare can lead to dullness, breakouts, and premature aging. Incorporating small, consistent actions each day makes a big difference.\

## **Morning Rituals for Glowing Skin**

1. **Gentle Cleansing**

   : Start your day with a mild cleanser to remove oil buildup.
2. **Apply Antioxidants**

   : Use Vitamin C serum to brighten skin and reduce damage from pollution.
3. **Sunscreen is Non-Negotiable**

   : Apply a broad-spectrum SPF to prevent aging and sunspots.

**Expert Tip:** Always apply sunscreen 15 minutes before stepping out for full protection.

## **Evening Rituals for Recovery**

1. **Double Cleansing**

   : Remove makeup and impurities with an oil-based cleanser, followed by a water-based cleanser.
2. **Use a Retinol Serum**

   : Incorporate retinol to target fine lines and improve skin texture.
3. **Hydrate Intensely**

   : A nourishing night cream locks in moisture and aids overnight repair.

**Pro Tip:** Avoid overusing active ingredients like retinol—stick to 2-3 times per week to prevent irritation.

## **Lifestyle Habits for Radiant Skin**

* **Drink More Water**

  : Hydration starts from within—aim for at least 8 glasses a day.
* **Eat Skin-Loving Foods**

  : Incorporate leafy greens, berries, and nuts rich in antioxidants.
* **Prioritize Sleep**

  : Your skin regenerates while you rest, so aim for 7-8 hours nightly.
