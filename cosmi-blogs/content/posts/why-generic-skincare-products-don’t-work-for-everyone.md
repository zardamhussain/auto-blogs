## Why Generic Skincare Products Don’t Work for Everyone  

Have you ever tried a highly-rated skincare product only to be disappointed by the results? You’re not alone. The truth is, generic skincare products often fail because they’re not designed for your unique skin needs.  

Your skin is as individual as your fingerprint. Factors like oiliness, hydration levels, acne, and even your environment shape what your skin requires. Generic products are created for the "average user," but here’s the catch—there’s no such thing as average skin.

## The Problems with Generic Skincare  

### 1. **They Ignore Your Unique Skin Concerns**  
Most skincare products are formulated for broad categories, like "dry" or "oily" skin. But what if your skin is a mix? For instance, you might have oily skin with patches of dryness or acne-prone skin that’s also sensitive. A generic product can’t address such complexity.  

### 2. **They Often Worsen the Problem**  
Using the wrong products can strip your skin’s natural oils, clog your pores, or even trigger breakouts. For example:  
- **Acne treatments:** Can over-dry your skin, causing it to produce even more oil.  
- **Hydration creams:** May feel heavy and clog pores if they’re not suited for your skin type.  

### 3. **They Don’t Evolve With Your Skin**  
Your skin changes over time. Seasonal shifts, hormonal changes, stress, and even diet can alter your skin’s needs. Generic products are static, but your skin isn’t.
