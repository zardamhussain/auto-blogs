*   **Combination Approach:** Many find success using Asian skincare for basic hydration, American skincare for targeted treatments, and European skincare for sun protection.
*   **Ingredient Research:** Do not follow trends blindly. Thorough research is important.

## Key Considerations:

*   **Skin Type:** Consider your skin type (oily, dry, combination, sensitive) when choosing products.
*   **Skin Concerns:** Identify your primary skin concerns (acne, aging, dryness, etc.).
*   **Ingredient Sensitivity:** Be aware of any ingredients that irritate your skin.
