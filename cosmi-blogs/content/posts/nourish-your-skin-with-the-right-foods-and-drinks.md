Ever wonder if your diet impacts your skin? While there’s still a lot to uncover in the science of food and complexion, it’s pretty clear that what you eat can influence your overall health and that includes your skin!  

Ever wonder if your diet impacts your skin? While there’s still a lot to uncover in the science of food and complexion, it’s pretty clear that what you eat can influence your overall health, and that includes your skin!

Eating more fruits and veggies might just give your skin that extra glow. And if you want to go a step further, reducing inflammation in your body can improve how your skin looks and even help prevent some health issues.


## Skin-Loving Foods to Add to Your Plate  

Here’s a list of foods that not only taste amazing but might also give your skin some extra TLC:  

- **Green Tea**  
  This is your go-to drink for antioxidants, especially green tea polyphenols. While it’s great for your body overall, some research even hints that it could reduce wrinkles and sun damage. Bonus points if you use skincare products with green tea extract!  

- **Salmon and Tuna**  
  These fish are loaded with omega-3s, which are fantastic for keeping your skin soft, hydrated, and smooth.  

- **Beans and Lentils**  
  Looking for a plant-based protein option? These are low in fat, high in nutrients, and skin-friendly.  

- **Lycopene Superstars**  
  Think tomatoes, watermelon, grapefruit, asparagus, and red cabbage. These foods are packed with lycopene, which helps protect your skin from damage.  

- **Whole Grains**  
  Oatmeal, quinoa, brown rice, and whole wheat pasta are full of B vitamins that help your skin repair and renew itself.  

## What to Avoid for Clearer Skin  

Your skin reflects what you put into your body, so it’s best to limit or avoid these:  

- **Smoking**  
  It ages your skin faster and messes with its texture.  

- **Too Much Sugar**  
  Indulging in sweets increases inflammation, which can make your skin age more quickly.  

- **Trans Fats**  
  These unhealthy fats found in fried food, margarine, and baked goods can trigger inflammation and harm your skin.  

- **Processed Carbs**  
  White bread, pizza crust, and pasta might taste great, but they can damage collagen, leading to wrinkles.  

- **Alcohol**  
  Keep it in moderation. Too much alcohol can dehydrate your skin and cause inflammation. Women should stick to one drink a day, and men to two.  

## Listen to Your Skin  

- Everyone’s skin reacts differently to foods. If you notice that something like dairy or sweets is causing breakouts or irritation, it’s probably a good idea to cut back.  

- Your skin is an extension of your overall health, so nourish it from the inside out. Add these healthy habits to your routine, and your skin (and body) will thank you!
