# The Ordinary vs. The INKEY List Azelaic Acid: A Sensitive Skin Showdown

Azelaic acid is a skincare powerhouse known for its brightening, redness-reducing, and smoothing properties. But with so many options on the market, how do you choose the right one, especially if you have sensitive skin? Today, we're comparing two popular azelaic acid serums: The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% and The INKEY List Azelaic Acid Serum.

## The Competitors

*   **The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%:** A widely available and affordable option from a well-known brand.
*   **The INKEY List Azelaic Acid Serum:** Another budget-friendly contender promising similar benefits.

## First Impressions: The Original Post

One user shared their experience testing both products, specifically focusing on their impact on sensitive, slightly dry skin with mild rosacea in a humid climate. Here's a breakdown:

### The Ordinary: A Rough Start (2/10)

*   **Pros:** Noticeable brightening, some redness reduction, smoother skin.
*   **Cons:** Severe irritation, burning/stinging, very drying, pilling.

Despite its effectiveness, the user found The Ordinary's formula too harsh, even with hydrating serums and moisturizers. The pilling issue was also a major drawback.

### The INKEY List: A Gentle Success (9/10)

*   **Pros:** Evens skin tone, smooths and brightens, decreases redness.
*   **Cons:** Irritating with twice-daily use.

The INKEY List serum proved to be a much gentler option, delivering satisfactory results without excessive dryness or irritation. The user found that using it once a day at night, layered with jojoba oil and an occlusive, yielded the best results.

## Diving Deeper: Key Differences & Considerations

*   **Texture:** The Ordinary has a thicker, cream-like texture, while The INKEY List is more of a spreadable serum.
*   **Scent:** The Ordinary has a noticeable, potentially unpleasant scent, while The INKEY List is virtually scent-free.
*   **Irritation Potential:** This is where the biggest difference lies. The Ordinary seems to be significantly more irritating, likely due to its formulation or other inactive ingredients.
*   **Results:** Both products are effective, but The INKEY List might be better suited for those seeking gradual improvement with less risk of irritation.

## Community Insights

Other individuals echoed similar sentiments, with some finding The Ordinary to be a holy grail product for redness reduction, while others suspect intolerance to an inactive ingredient in the formula. It is always important to gradually introduce active ingredients into your skincare routine to allow your skin to adjust and minimize potential irritation.

## The Verdict

For sensitive skin, **The INKEY List Azelaic Acid Serum** appears to be the clear winner. It delivers the benefits of azelaic acid without the harshness and irritation associated with The Ordinary's suspension. While individual results may vary, this comparison suggests that The INKEY List is a safer bet for those prone to sensitivity.
