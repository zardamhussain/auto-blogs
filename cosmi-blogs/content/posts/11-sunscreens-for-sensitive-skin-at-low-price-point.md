# The Ultimate Guide to Affordable Sunscreens for Sensitive Skin

Finding a sunscreen that doesn't irritate sensitive skin can feel like an impossible task. Many sunscreens contain harsh chemicals or fragrances that trigger reactions, leading to redness, itching, and breakouts. But fear not! Protecting your skin from the sun is essential, and it's possible to do so without breaking the bank or causing irritation. This guide reviews several budget-friendly sunscreens perfect for sensitive skin, based on extensive testing and real-world experiences.

## Understanding Sensitive Skin and Sunscreen

Sensitive skin requires gentle formulations. Key factors to consider when choosing a sunscreen include:

*   **Ingredients:** Look for sunscreens free of alcohol, fragrances, parabens, and oxybenzone.
*   **Type of Sunscreen:** Mineral sunscreens (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide) are often better tolerated than chemical sunscreens. However, newer generation chemical sunscreens are also available with gentler formulations.
