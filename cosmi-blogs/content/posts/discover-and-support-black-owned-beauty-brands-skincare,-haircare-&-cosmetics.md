## Considerations Regarding Brand Ownership

While this list primarily focuses on independent Black-owned brands, it's important to acknowledge that the landscape of larger beauty companies can involve complex ownership structures. Some brands with Black founders may have significant investment or majority ownership from large corporations, which can influence where profits are distributed. Notable examples often discussed include Fenty Beauty/Skin (part of LVMH), SheaMoisture (owned by Unilever), and Carol's Daughter (owned by L'Oréal). Consumers interested in supporting fully independent Black-owned businesses may wish to research specific brand ownership structures to align their choices with their values.
