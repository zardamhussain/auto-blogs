# Beauty of Joseon Sunscreen Discontinued in the US: What You Need to Know

It's disheartening news for fans of Beauty of Joseon (BOJ) sunscreens in the United States. Due to FDA regulations, several popular BOJ sunscreens are being pulled from the US market. This includes the highly praised Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics SPF50+ PA++++, the Aqua Rich variant, the serum version, and the stick format. Here's what you need to know and where you can still find these beloved products.

## Why the Discontinuation?

The issue lies with the specific UV filters used in these sunscreens. These filters, while widely approved and used in Asia, are not yet on the FDA's approved list. This means that while these sunscreens are safe and effective elsewhere, they cannot legally be sold as sunscreens in the US.

While this was anticipated due to the brand's announcement of their plans to produce sunscreens using FDA-approved filters, it doesn't make the news any less disappointing for many.

## Which Sunscreens Are Affected?

The following Beauty of Joseon sunscreens are being discontinued in the US:

*   Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics SPF50+ PA++++
*   Aqua Rich SPF variant
*   Serum SPF variant
*   Sun stick

## Where to Still Purchase Beauty of Joseon Sunscreens

While the brand's US website will no longer carry these products, there's hope for those who swear by them. Third-party retailers like Stylevana and YesStyle, which specialize in Asian beauty products, are expected to continue to offer the original Japanese formulations.

Many are already stocking up as the news broke. Some customers are taking advantage of discount codes to buy in bulk, ensuring they have their favorite sunscreen on hand, demonstrating how much people love the BOJ formulations.

### Why the Love for These Sunscreens?

Many have expressed frustration with the FDA's slow adoption of new and improved SPF filters used in other countries. Fans of Asian sunscreens appreciate them for their superior formulations which are considered more cosmetically elegant than many US sunscreens. Many mention how these sunscreens don't sting the eyes, are lightweight, and feel great on the skin.

## Alternative Strategies

Some have also proposed that Korean companies should label these as something other than sunscreen so they remain accessible to US consumers. This is something Krave Beauty did, allowing their sunscreens to continue to be sold. While it's a creative solution, it shows how much these products are valued.

## Final Thoughts

It's frustrating that a product widely loved and considered effective is now harder to obtain in the US. While this is the current reality, it highlights the growing interest in skincare products and the importance of a global perspective on beauty and skincare innovation. If you're a Beauty of Joseon fan, consider purchasing through third-party retailers like Stylevana and YesStyle, and stock up while you still can!
