## 5 Not-So-Expensive Foods That Will Help You Anti-Age  

Heavy moisturizing creams, collagen-rich products, maybe a little Botox here and there, lots of sunscreen, and massaging your face upwards. There are all sorts of tips, tricks, and advice about keeping your skin super-firm and wrinkle-free as you begin to age. But just like your mama always told you that "pretty is as pretty does," the same goes for getting older: you have to give your body the essential nutrients it needs to help your skin retain its elasticity and that youthful glow you wish you could just bottle up forever and ever.   

### Nourishing Your Skin From Within  
So how do you ensure that what you’re consuming is helping you fight your skin’s biological clock? By making sure your diet is rich in nutrients, vitamins, and ingredients that keep you healthy and young.  
“As we get older, our gut doesn't absorb nutrients as well. It's important to make healthy choices for foods that nourish our body and skin,” says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Jessie Cheung.  

### Here’s what Dr. Cheung suggests for a diet that supports anti-aging skin:  

#### 1. Nibble on Low-Sugar Snacks  
You might reach for that extra glass of vino or indulge in a rich piece of chocolate cake every once in a while, but having excess sugar in your diet can make your skin age faster than you’d like.  
“Sugar in the bloodstream links to protein and creates Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs), which are distorted and dysfunctional,” explains Cheung. “These AGEs cause chronic inflammation and contribute to wrinkles, atherosclerosis, and arthritis.”  

Instead of drooling over doughnuts or juices that hide their sugar content, Cheung recommends focusing on a low-glycemic diet with plenty of fiber, like whole wheat crackers, baby carrots, and celery. These help regulate sugar spikes when you have late-night or mid-afternoon cravings.  

#### 2. Eat More Berries  
What’s one of the key ingredients your body needs to keep your skin in its prime state? No surprise here: collagen!  
As we age, we lose the naturally occurring collagen we’re born with, producing less and less with each year. That’s why Cheung suggests munching on berries—strawberries, blueberries, raspberries—when you need a snack. Why? These fresh, colorful fruits are high in Vitamin C and antioxidants, both of which aid in collagen formation and help protect your skin from damage.  

#### 3. Choose Oily Fish  
If you’re a fan of seafood, you’re in luck: it’s one of the best protein sources for maintaining tender, firm skin.  
Fish are a great source of Omega-3 fatty acids, which are anti-inflammatory and help your skin stay radiant. Cheung recommends going for the oiliest fish you can find, such as smoked salmon, swordfish, mackerel, and tilapia. These are high in Vitamin D, which supports your immune system and keeps your skin glowing without sun damage.  

#### 4. Munch on a Handful of Nuts  
Nuts, especially almonds, are a classic recommendation from nutritionists. In addition to regulating weight and keeping you full, they help fight aging.  
“Nuts are a great source of antioxidants and are rich in minerals like zinc and selenium,” says Cheung. “These boost our immune system and thyroid function.” Plus, they’re packed with concentrated healthy unsaturated fats that are excellent for maintaining skin hydration.  

#### 5. Go for the Yogurt  
Keeping your immune system strong prevents breakouts and skin issues, meaning fewer scars to deal with over time.  
Cheung suggests eating yogurt regularly. It acts as a natural probiotic to promote gut health, which in turn regulates nutrient absorption. Bonus: yogurt is delicious, making it an easy addition to your routine!
