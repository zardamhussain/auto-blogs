# Skincare Overload: Confessions of a Product Junkie (and 59 Honest Reviews)

Okay, I have a confession to make: my bathroom cabinet was a skincare graveyard. Years of impulse buys, samples, and the allure of the next miracle product had created a monster. So, I did the only reasonable thing – I purged, and then I reviewed. Here's my brutally honest take on 59 products, from cleansers to sunscreens, plus insights into my ever-evolving routine. Buckle up!

## My Skin Story

I'm 39, fair-skinned, freckled, and burn easily. My skin is sensitive, leans dry, and craves hydration. Pregnancy threw my skin for a loop, resulting in hormonal acne and bumpy texture. Thankfully, I've found a routine that works, and I'm now happier with my skin than ever before. I also get regular Botox/Dysport injections for forehead lines.

## My Current Routine:

**AM:**

*   Gentle cleanser in the shower
*   Vitamin C serum
*   Moisturizer
*   SPF
*   Light makeup (BB cream, blush, setting powder, mascara)

**PM:**

*   Micellar water to remove eye makeup
*   Double cleanse
*   Hypochlorous acid spray (for chin breakouts - more on that later!)
*   **Cycle (every 3 days):**
    *   Tretinoin
    *   Chemical exfoliant (BHA or Glycolic)
    *   Deep hydration/slugging
*   Moisturizer
*   Beekman 1802 Milkshake
*   Rosehip Seed oil
*   Aquaphor (slugging nights)

## The Product Lineup: Reviews & Recommendations

Here's the breakdown of everything I tried, divided by category, along with my honest opinions:

### Cleansers

1.  **Simple Micellar Cleansing Water:** A staple for removing makeup, especially eye makeup. Gentle and effective. *Verdict: Repurchase, but not brand loyal.*
2.  **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser:** My skin loves this. Removes everything without stripping. *Verdict: Automatic repurchase.*
3.  **Naturium Cleansing Balm:** Melts away makeup beautifully, but a bit pricey for the amount you get. *Verdict: Might repurchase if on sale.*
4.  **Benefit Get Unblocked Cleansing Oil:** Great for a double cleanse. *Verdict: Might splurge on a full size.*
5.  **Tower 28 SOS Daily Rescue Facial Spray:** Not technically a cleanser, but a game-changer for chin breakouts (thanks, maskne!). *Verdict: Love it, but looking for a cheaper dupe (Briotech is on the way!).*

### Toners

1.  **Paula's Choice Enriched Calming Toner:** Didn't notice a significant difference. *Verdict: Won't repurchase.*
2.  **Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Hyaluronic Toner:** Nice consistency, hydrating, but not essential. *Verdict: Might repurchase if trying to meet a free shipping minimum.*
3.  **Beekman 1802 Milkshake Facial Toner:** Expensive, but my face loves it. Super hydrating and sets makeup beautifully. *Verdict: Must-have! Will keep buying.*

### Acids & Exfoliants

1.  **Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant:** Keeps my skin clear. *Verdict: Great, but will likely try another BHA when I finish this bottle.*
2.  **The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution:** A holy grail for tightening skin and exfoliating dry patches. *Verdict: Always repurchase!*
3.  **Paula's Choice 25% AHA + 2% BHA Exfoliant Peel:** Nice for occasional exfoliation, but the 10-minute wait feels like an eternity. *Verdict: Probably won't repurchase.*
4.  **Malezia 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide:** Gentle and hydrating formula, perfect for spot treatment. *Verdict: The best BP I've ever tried! Ordering another one soon.*

### Serums & Actives

1.  **Mad Hippie Vitamin C Serum:** Great serum with a thicker consistency, feels extra hydrating. *Verdict: Keep in rotation.*
2.  **Maelove The Glow Maker:** Effective Vitamin C. *Verdict: Staple in my vitamin C rotation.*
3.  **Paula's Choice Vitamin C:** Didn't see any brightening effects. *Verdict: Won't repurchase.*
4.  **Derma E Vitamin C:** More of a hydrating product with Vitamin C, not a true serum. *Verdict: Won't repurchase.*
5.  **The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%:** Subtle tightening effects. *Verdict: Probably won't repurchase.*
6.  **The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5%:** A must-have for business trips to help with eye puffiness. *Verdict: Keep in my arsenal.*
7.  **The Ordinary Multi-Peptide + Copper Peptides 1%:** Skin likes it, but hard to tell if it's truly effective. *Verdict: Probably try another brand first.*
8.  **The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2%:** A staple for hydrating lips. *Verdict: Continually repurchase.*
9.  **Purito Centella Green Level Buffet Serum:** Skin felt irritated. *Verdict: Won't purchase.*
10. **Paula's Choice 1% Retinol:** Good, but prescription tretinoin is better. *Verdict: Won't repurchase.*
11. **BYOMA Brightening Serum:** Hyaluronic acid in a cute bottle. *Verdict: Won't repurchase.*
12. **Caudalie Resveratrol Lift:** Expensive and didn't love the smell. *Verdict: Won't purchase.*
13. **Retin-A Cream .025% (Prescription Tretinoin):** Great and makes skin feel like velvet. *Verdict: Love it!*
14. **Tinitrend Tretinoina 0.05%:** Effective, more oily consistency. *Verdict: Would definitely get more if I had the opportunity.*
15. **Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment:** Thick, green, and dries down to a sallow beige. *Verdict: Hate it, won't repurchase!*

### Moisturizers & Emollients

1.  **Dr. Jart+ Ceramidin Cream:** Gorgeous moisturizer with a beautiful finish. *Verdict: Love this and will probably repurchase.*
2.  **Vanicream Moisturizing Cream:** A workhorse, great for sensitive skin. *Verdict: A staple, will always have on hand.*
3.  **Malezia Urea Moisturizer:** Incredible for fixing a damaged moisture barrier. *Verdict: Will always support this company and product!*
4.  **Trader Joe's Brazil Nut Body Butter:** Good, thick cream, but I prefer oils. *Verdict: Won't run out to restock, but might pick it up again.*
5.  **Welly Daily Hydration Body Lotion:** Surprisingly hydrating. *Verdict: A staple, will continuously rebuy.*
6.  **Aquaphor Healing Ointment:** A non-negotiable essential for lips, slugging, and dry feet. *Verdict: A must-have!*

### BB Creams

1.  **Purito Cica Clearing BB Cream:** Amazing BB cream. *Verdict: Best BB I've tried, probably going to be my staple!*
2.  **Skin79 BB Super+ Beblesh Balm:** A little goes a long way. *Verdict: Not bad, but going to finish the bottle, won't repurchase.*
3.  **Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer Natural Skin Perfector:** Texture is nice, but oxidizes badly on me. *Verdict: A mystery. Will not repurchase.*
4.  **Glossier Perfecting Skin Tint:** Too sheer for me. *Verdict: Used the bottle, but won't repurchase.*

### Makeup & Miscellaneous

1.  **Patrick Ta Major Headlines Double-Take Crème & Powder Blush Duo:** Gorgeous packaging, but too pigmented for me. *Verdict: Beautiful product, but not for me. Will not repurchase.*
2.  **Flower Beauty Blush Bomb Color Drops for Cheeks:** Gives me a healthy, natural glow. *Verdict: Will definitely rebuy.*
